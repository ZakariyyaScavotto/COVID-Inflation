Note: part of justifications to remove is there being on partial autocorrelation (PAC), this is because
    when the PAC doesn't pass the threshold for any lags, it is an indicator that the timeseries is likely random
    (white noise), meaning that it won't do the models any good

2008-9 dummy variable: ignore because it was from a random test, AnnualizedMoM-CPI-Inflation: ignore because it is the target
Banana price: no PAC, between that and its lack of relative importance per the BLS good to remove?
Bread price: very weak at lag 1, could potentially remove?
Chicken price: some PAC at lag 1
Egg price: no PAC, could be good to remove
Electricity: some at lags 1, 4, (8, 12?)
Gas: 1, 2
Ground beef: practically no PAC, may be removed
Housing start: 1
HPI: 1, 2, 3
IndPro: 1, 2 are weak, weary to remove due to economic significance
MichInflationExpect: Very strong at 1
Milk: moderate at 1
Retnal price: strong at 1, moderate at 2, 7
Unemployment rate: no PAC, weary to remove due to potential economic sig when COVID comes around
Utilities: 1
